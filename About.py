When I was struggling with strong PMS and irregular periods, I did not want to go back on birth control as the proposed solution, especially 
because I am trying to concieve. It took about two years measuring BBT and researching how to heal with nutrition to understand my body and finally able to have healthy cycles.

I came across a list of foods :avocado: to eat per cycles. My cycles are normally healthier with less PMS and actual ovulations when I adhere to this list.
Nutrition has a powerful affect on our bodies and I wanted this to be accessible to more people. I thought, wouldn't it be great 
to be able to look at some recipes with these ingredients customized to my:
   
    + menstrual phase ü©∏
    + follicular phase üå±
    + ovulatory phase ü•ö
    + luteal phase 	üçÇ

Sign up and get some recommended recipes catered to your cycle phase! Happy cycle syncing! It's time to feel better, in control,
and let thy food be thy medicine.
